# Overview

This is basic, all-in-one, chat ui for ollama. For simplicity it is bundled with a go server and packaged into a all-in-one binary.
Simply build/download the binary and start chatting ...

# Usage

1. Start ollama
2. Start ollama-ui binary

# Development

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install
# run development web server
npm run dev
# build project
npm run build

# run tests
npm run test:unit
# lint project
npm run lint
```

To build the all-in-one go server binary do:

```sh
go generate
go build
```

The resulting binary is a all-in-one bundle (i.e. webserver + website). All you need to do is to start the binary and point your browser to http://localhost:3000

(the only other prerequisite is that ollama is running on your machine as well)

# TODO

- ability to send system messages (pre set system messages for different tasks?)

  - e.g. a selector at the imput field

- markdown support + highlighting
- ability to easily copy/paste code

- delete/clear chat
  - prune history (e.g only last x messages, automatically remove older ones? long history?)
- save chat
- indicator if message has an attachment
- show indicator for attachment in input prompt (also need to be able to remove the image)
- message - indication timestamp send/answered / progress indication
- indicator when message is generated by ollama/model
- abort current message/prompt

- abort for model download / error message if model does not exist

- ability to upload PDF/text file

- font?
